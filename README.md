# Modal Personal DevBox Launcher

## Backstory

I'm not a developer with a fancy laptop. My setup is humble, just my trusty old Samsung phone. This is my digital workhorse:

```
u0_a191 @localhost
-----------------
OS: Android 7.1.1 armv7l
Host: samsung SM-G600S
Kernel: 3.10.49-13209801
CPU: Qualcomm MSM8916 (4) @ 998MHz
Memory: 1484MiB / 1889MiB
```

As you can see, it's not exactly a powerhouse. Trying to do any kind of serious work on it was a constant struggle. The phone would get hot enough to be uncomfortable, lag at the worst possible times, and just couldn't handle the tools I wanted to experiment with. It was frustrating.

Then, I remembered hearing about Modal and its serverless platform. A lightbulb went on. What if I could stop fighting my phone's limitations and just... bypass them? The idea was born: to create a simple way to launch a powerful, full-featured development environment in the cloud, offloading all the heavy lifting.

This project is the result of that idea. It's a script that lets me—and you—spin up a personal DevBox from anywhere, turning even a modest device into a portal to a powerful remote machine.

## Overview

This repository contains a Modal script (`devbox.py`) for launching a secure, personal, and on-demand remote development environment (DevBox). It provides a flexible and cost-effective way to get a powerful, cloud-based development environment with persistent storage, accessible via SSH.

The script launches a general-purpose DevBox, a Debian environment with essential development tools, and allows for the dynamic installation of extra packages at launch time.

## Features

-   **Standard DevBox**: A general-purpose Debian environment with essential development tools (`git`, `vim`, `curl`, `build-essential`, etc.). Allows for dynamic installation of extra `apt` packages at launch time.
-   **Persistent Storage**: Uses a `modal.Volume` to provide a persistent `/data` directory, ensuring your work is saved between sessions.
-   **Secure SSH Access**: Automatically injects your public SSH key for secure, passwordless access.
-   **Auto-Shutdown**: Includes an idle timer that automatically shuts down the container after 5 minutes of inactivity to save costs.
-   **Resource Allocation**: The environment is configured with appropriate CPU and memory resources for its intended task.
-   **Interactive Launcher**: A simple command-line prompt to customize your DevBox at launch.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, you need to have the following:

1.  **Python**: Python 3.8 or newer installed on your local machine.
2.  **Modal Account**: A free Modal account. You can sign up at [modal.com](https://modal.com/).
3.  **Modal CLI**: The `modal` Python library installed and configured.
    ```bash
    pip install modal
    modal setup
    ```
4.  **SSH Key Pair**: An SSH key pair generated on your local machine. If you don't have one, you can create it with:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```

## Setup

The script requires your **public SSH key** to be stored in a Modal Secret.

1.  **Find your public key**: Your public key is usually located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Copy the entire content of this file.

2.  **Create a Modal Secret**: Create a secret on Modal named `ssh-public-key` with a key of `PUBKEY`.

    You can do this from your terminal:
    ```bash
    modal secret create ssh-public-key PUBKEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"
    ```
    This command creates the secret and securely stores your public key in it.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can launch a DevBox by running the script:

```bash
modal run devbox.py
```

You will be prompted to enter any additional `apt` packages you want to install (e.g., `htop tmux`).

After making a selection, Modal will build the container image (if it's the first time) and start the environment. Once ready, it will print the SSH command you need to connect:

```
🚀 Your DevBox is ready!
Paste this command into your terminal:

ssh root@<host> -p <port>
```

Copy and paste this command into a new terminal window to connect to your remote DevBox.

### Alias for Quick Launch

To make launching your DevBox even faster, you can create an alias for the `modal run devbox.py` command in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or PowerShell profile).

**For Bash/Zsh:**

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
alias devbox="modal run /path/to/your/modal-terminal/devbox.py"
```

Remember to replace `/path/to/your/modal-terminal/` with the actual path to your `devbox.py` file. After saving, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can simply type `devbox` in your terminal to launch your DevBox.

**For PowerShell:**

Add the following lines to your PowerShell profile (you can open it by typing `$profile` and then `notepad $profile` in PowerShell):

```powershell
function Start-DevBox { modal run C:\path\to\your\modal-terminal\devbox.py }
Set-Alias -Name devbox -Value Start-DevBox
```

Remember to replace `C:\path\to\your\modal-terminal\devbox.py` with the actual path to your `devbox.py` file. After saving, restart PowerShell or run `. $profile`.

### Important Notes

-   **Persistent Storage**: Only the `/data` directory is persistent. Your home directory (`/root`) is ephemeral and will be reset every time the container starts. **Always save your important work in the `/data` directory.**
-   **Idle Timeout**: The container will automatically shut down after 5 minutes if there is no active SSH connection. A countdown will be displayed in the terminal where you ran the `modal run` command.
-   **Package Installation**: If you need `python`, type `python-is-python3` in the package list to ensure the correct Debian package is installed. The script handles this replacement automatically if you enter `python`.
